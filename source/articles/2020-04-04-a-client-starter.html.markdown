  XSCALE: A learning ecosystem for eXponential Simple Continuous Autonomous Learning Ecosystems
---

This a suggestion for proposed work at a client for a three-week engagement with a coaching group focused on transmitting self-management and business agility principles, and building trust with coaching and product group stakeholders. Critical activities include workshops and lectures for coaching and methodology staff with topics to be covered including but not limited to:

[Self-Propagating Transformation] : a change method that develops a slender but uncompromised end to end capability, then grows it by splitting and doubling at an exponential rate. Pulling organization into culture rather than pushing culture into organization.

[Leadership As A Service] : a decision-making protocol consisting of three simple practices that combine to consistently generate self-organization, trust, intelligent trade-offs and timely consensus decisions in small teams

[3D Kanban] : a form of Kanban that respects YAGNI, minimizes analytic WIP, and maintains breadth-first context for collaborative decision-making at all scales without generating unnecessary costs of change.

[Open Space] : a knowledge-finding and social-learning format for large groups in which the agenda is systematically prioritized by the group, explored by the group, and summarized by the group. Open spaces serve as input to change-constraint assessment and change-participant awareness-raising.

[Mu Hin Shu] : a principle for decentralized learning ecosystems in which learning is continuously shared for the mutual benefit of the participants, rather than standardized and exploited to maintain a power hierarchy. The opposite and complement to “Shu Ha Ri”.

[Round Councils] : a system of self-management in which teams are striped by quality circles and circle representatives are rotated into face to face meetings with experts and stakeholders on a regular cadence to prioritize outcomes and refine working agreements. 

[Throughput Accounting] : a management accounting system in which decisions are intelligently based on prioritizing contributions to top-line business throughput, not singularly fixed on minimization of operating expense. Truly variable costs are still systematically minimized.

[Open Book Management] : a reward model in which financial incentives are continuously indexed to top line business performance, not individual KPIs. OBM dramatically reduces internal politics while generating collaboration and speech-from-integrity at all levels.

[Ecosystems Thinking] : an assessment and design method for networks of mutual benefit that emphasizes continuous whole-board strategies, breadth-first reductive reasoning, and non-local coaching strategies focused on opening organizational bottlenecks to learning flow.
