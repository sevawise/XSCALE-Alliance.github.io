I love to guide software teams on their journey to deliver valuable software and becoming a great team. I help organizations to create an environment where teams can shine.

Besides an XSCALE Product Management Coach and PSM III certified Scrum Master, 
I am an agile developer, pragmatic student, team player and coach. 
I have been active in the field of software development for well over fifteen years.

I work in an open and transparent way, sometimes confronting, 
but always respectful towards people and with the organization's goals in mind. 
I think I'm skillful and knowledgeable, 
yet I continuously find that there are better ways to go about my work.
There still is much for me to learn.
