## Developing

The site is built using [Middleman], so you need [Ruby] on your system.
Clone the repository and check out the `source` branch. 
From the root of the repository:

```
make setup
make test
```

This will install all the required dependencies and build the site.

To run the site and start developmnent:

```
make server
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:4567.
See [Middleman development cycle] to get started.

## Deploying

To deploy the website:

```
make deploy
```

This will build the site, publish the build output to the master branch 
and push the master branch to its tracking branch.

Currently, Peter is the only person who publishes the website.

A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.
